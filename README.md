# image_stitch
This project is related to comparing the different stitching algorithms.
I have compared differnt stitching algorithms SIFT, SURF, BRISK, ORB and NCC in terms of accuracy and time taken. Accomplished stitching of upto 50 images with an accuracy of 95%. Code for execution of NCC is given in this repository. 
Input is video of microscopic images for this code. Code for stitching starts with main.py.

Accuracy is measured on the basis of macro analysis and partial DCT analysis. Code for scoring the quality of stitching starts in macro.py.
